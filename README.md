# ગુજરાતી શીખો — Learn Gujarati for Kids 🪷

A beautiful, interactive web app for kids (ages 4–12) to learn Gujarati using AI-powered **speech**, **images**, and **conversation**. Built on **Krashen's Comprehensible Input / Natural Approach** methodology — listen first, understand through context, then speak. No pressure, just fun! 🎉

## ✨ Features

### Alphabet
- **13 swar (vowels)** and **34 vyanjan (consonants)**, each with its own audio and illustration
- Every letter has an example word in Gujarati, romanisation, and English
- Two practice modes per letter: **listen**, and **trace** it with a finger
- Hold the mic to say it back and get a gentle three-star read

Retroflex letters carry IAST diacritics (ટ `ṭa`, ઠ `ṭha`, ડ `ḍa`, ઢ `ḍha`,
ણ `ṇa`, ષ `ṣa`, ળ `ḷa`) so they no longer collide with the dental row — which
had been making seven letters show the wrong picture and play the wrong sound.

### Vocabulary
- **283 words** across 10 groups: animals, fruit, colours, body, family, food,
  nature, numbers, festivals, and Surat
- Each group has its own ink and its own drawn mark
- Every word has audio and an illustration; tap a card for a swipeable deck

### Phrases
- **20+ essential phrases**: Greetings, Questions, Daily Use, Polite Expressions, Emotions
- **3 difficulty levels** (i, i+1, i+2) based on Comprehensible Input theory
- Listen & repeat approach — hear first, then speak

### Stories and nursery rhymes
- **48 bilingual stories**, including familiar Indian children's-book classics
- **9 balgeet (nursery rhymes)** — ચક્કીબેન, એક બિલાડી જાડી, મામાનું ઘર કેટલે,
  હાથીભાઈ તો જાડા, આવ રે વરસાદ, વારતા રે વારતા, ચાંદો સૂરજ, અડકો દડકો, તાળી પાડો —
  each with a sing-along that highlights the line being sung
- **Narrated story films for all 48 stories**: a riso title plate, a slow push
  into each line's own illustration held for exactly as long as its narration,
  and a closing moral plate read aloud in Gujarati and English
- **A spoken moral** for every story — tap the speaker beside "What the story
  teaches" to hear it
- Comprehensible Input stories: understand Gujarati from context
- Simple bilingual lines and clear morals for each lesson
- Tap the story title or individual lines to hear audio

### Listen & Find (સાંભળો · શોધો)
- A pure ear game: a word is spoken, four pictures are shown, the child taps
- **8 rounds** per game, filterable by word group
- No captions until a second miss — the ear does the work, then the words appear
- Same-group distractors, so a lion sits among animals rather than among fruits
- Words found on the first try are stamped and counted as learned

### Quiz
- Dynamic quiz generator for Letters, Words, and Phrases
- **3 difficulty levels** with randomized questions
- Confetti animation on good scores! 🎊
- Track stars earned across sessions

### ગુજુ (Guju), the AI tutor
- Chat with Guju, your friendly Gujarati-speaking AI tutor
- **Voice input**: Press & hold the mic button to speak in Gujarati or English
- **Voice output**: Tap 🔊 to hear Guju's responses
- Learn about culture: Navratri, Uttarayan, Dhokla, Garba, and more
- Starter and follow-up prompt chips that get gradually harder over the conversation

### Sound
- A small voice of its own: taps, right answers, gentle retries, a star and a
  win — marimba, manjira and glockenspiel, generated in the same folk palette
- **Songs carry a music bed**: one instrumental loop per nursery rhyme, held
  well under the voice so the words stay the subject
- A **Sounds** switch on Progress — a child can silence the whole app

### Progress
- Track letters, words, phrases, and stories learned
- Earn badges as you progress: 🚀 → 🌱 → 🎯 → 🌟 → 🏆
- Quiz accuracy stats
- Progress persists in localStorage

## 🧠 Learning Method

Based on **Stephen Krashen's Natural Approach**:

1. **Comprehensible Input (i+1)**: Content is slightly above current level
2. **Low Anxiety**: No penalty for mistakes — gentle correction by repeating the right way
3. **Meaningful Context**: Learn through stories, cultural references, and real conversations
4. **Listening First**: Hear sounds before attempting to speak (audio-first design)
5. **Play-Based**: Quizzes, animations, and achievements keep kids engaged
6. **Retrieval + Spacing**: Guju recommends follow-up prompts that review, interleave, and add one harder step

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations

npx tsx scripts/venice-fill.mts image    # new section art

# Build every narrated story film locally — ffmpeg only, no API calls, resumable
python3 scripts/build_films.py --list
python3 scripts/build_films.py
python3 scripts/add_beds.py              # lay the music bed under older films

# Optional: buy per-shot animated clips instead of stills (paid, slow)
npx tsx scripts/make-story-films.mts thirsty-crow hare-tortoise

# Redraw the app icons, maskable icons, and the social card (no API calls)

## Design

The interface is a **two-colour risograph print**, the same world the 700+
generated illustrations live in — saffron `#ef5a23` and indigo `#1d3c6e` inks on
cream `#f6efdd` paper with visible fibre grain, hard 2.5px ink keylines, flat
offset second-pass shadows, halftone screens, and Ajrakh lozenge borders.

- **One token system.** `src/app/globals.css` holds every ink, space, radius,
  type step, and motion value. There is no second palette.
- **One component vocabulary.** `src/components/ui.tsx` owns the card decks,
  the play button, chips, segmented tabs, meters, overlays, and the
  say-it-back panel. A control defined there is never re-implemented inline.
- **Drawn marks, never emoji.** `src/components/Icon.tsx` is an authored SVG
  set on one 24×24 grid at 2px stroke.
- **Audio first.** Anything a child can see, they can hear in one tap.
- **Never punish.** The lowest outcome anywhere is "have another go".
- **Structurally responsive.** A phone gets a bottom tab bar and a floating
  Guju button; a tablet gets an icon rail; a desktop gets a labelled sidebar
  and multi-column content. Nothing is merely a stretched phone.
- **Motion conveys state.** Pressing anything pushes it into the paper and its
  offset ink pass collapses underneath. `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured.
